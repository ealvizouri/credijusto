# Welcome to CRYPTOX Storybook

This is an example of how to properly document **UI components**. Here you
can find a few examples as **Button**, **Input** and **QuoteCard** components.

With Storybook developers can document and test isoleted components for improving consitency and quality.
During the development process stories can help new team members learn about the component's project in a faster and orginized pace.

It also helps **Design** and **QA** team to ensure each component has the required needs. Furthermore, they can revisit these
stories whenever they want without scheduling unecessary meetings with development team.

, greetings!
