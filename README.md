# Welcome to CRYPTOX project

Hello OptimHire and Credijusto teams, I'm honored you took the time to evaluate me and give me the chance to be part of your team.

## Before running any npm command be sure to be in '/client' folder:

#### `cd client`

## Here's how we make this run:

#### `npm install`

#### `npm start`

## For running tests:

#### `npm test`

## I use Storybook for documentating some components, please run:

#### `npm run storybook`
